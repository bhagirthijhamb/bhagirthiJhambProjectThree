How we add JavaScript functionality to add items and manipulate items in the cart for an E-commerce website.

- A landing page with the app heading, "Dress n Style" followed by a gallery of all the products that the website has to offer for purchase.

- When scrolled down, in the 'Our Products' section, when we hover over the item, the 'Add to Cart' link shows up. 

- The user clicks the itemto add the item to the cart. 

- There will be a cart icon button that will open up the cart when clciked. 

- The cart will show number of items and total amount for all the items.

- An the alert can be added to show the customer that the item has been added to the cart.

- The cart icon will also updates to show the no of items in the cart. 

- The total amount gets updated and the items in the cart also gets updated. 

- Display the money total and item total in the cart.

- Use local storage so even when the page is refreshed, the items persist in the cart.

----------------------------------------------------------------


- A remove button can be added below each item in the cart, to remove the item from the cart. 

- We can also have a item increase and decrease button for each item in the cart.

- If we decrease the no of items with the down arrow and once we go below 1 (i.e. zero item), the item will be removed from the cart.

- The cart can be ceared altogether with the 'CLEAR CART' button in the cart.
